		<p id="blessed-lyrics">Everywhere that I go, everywhere that I be</br>
			If you are not surrounding me with your energy</br>
			I don't wanna be there, don't wanna be anywhere</br>
			Any place that I can't feel you, I just wanna be near you</br>
			And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed</br>
			To be stuck with you</br>
			Sometimes it gets unhealthy</br>
			We can't be by ourselves, we</br>
			We'll always need each other, and</br>
			Yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed</br>
			To be stuck with you</br>
			I just want you to know that</br>
			If I could I swear I'll go back</br>
			Make everything all better, whoa</br>
			It's the things that you say</br>
			It's the way that you pray</br>
			Pray on my insecurities</br>
			I know you're feeling me</br>
			I know sometimes I do wrong</br>
			But hear the words of this song</br>
			When I go I don't stay gone for long</br>
			Don't know what's going on</br>
			And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed</br>
			To be stuck with you</br>
			Sometimes it gets unhealthy</br>
			We can't be by ourselves, we</br>
			We'll always need each other, and</br>
			Yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed</br>
			To be stuck with you</br>
			I just want you to know that</br>
			If I could I swear I'll go back</br>
			Make everything all better, whoa</br>
			And I'm coming back home to you</br>
			And I'm coming back home to you</br>
			I'm coming back home</br>
			I'm coming back home to you</br>
			I'm coming back home</br>
			I'm coming back home to you</br>
			I'm coming back home</br>
			I'm coming back home to you</br>
			I'm coming back home</br>
			I'm coming back home to you</br>
			I'm coming back home</br>
			I'm coming back home to you</br>
			I'm coming back home</br>
			And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed</br>
			To be stuck with you</br>
			Sometimes it gets unhealthy</br>
			We can't be by ourselves, we</br>
			We'll always need each other, and</br>
			Yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed</br>
			To be stuck with you</br>
			I just want you to know that</br>
			If I could I swear I'll go back</br>
			Make everything all better, whoa</p>
